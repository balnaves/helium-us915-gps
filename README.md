# Adafruit M0 LoRa Feather GPS Data Logger for the Helium Network

Code for GPS logging over the Helium Things network (LoRaWan).
I got an Adafruit LoRa Feather to try out the Helium network and had a TBS M8 GPS module lying around so decided to hook it up.
Uses the `MCCI_LoRaWAN_LMIC_library` and `NeoGPS` libraries.
It's based on some code in https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino with a tweak for Helium and added GPS code.
